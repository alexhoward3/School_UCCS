Purpose:
To create a robust and fully functional game of BlackJack to
be played by one player against the computer.

Compilation:
Manual compile using Cygwin 2.850(64 bit) and the GNU Compiler Collection.
gcc --std=c99 helloworld.c -o helloworld

Problems Encountered:
I had to use pointers to pass cards back to the dealer and the player's hand arrays.
Using a struct to create an "object" probably was slightly beyond my capabilities before
I tried it but it managed to turn out okay. I'm not quite sure I used structs in the "proper" format
however...

Testing:
I had to test for each "end" or "win" condition. Running the program as many times as I could while also
forcing the dealer or player to have specific hands was part of it. For example, I tested the player and
dealer having one or more aces. All inputs and numbers were also bounds-checked to make sure they did not
induce an error. The bet could not be higher than the token amount etc.

Making the assignment better:
I thought the assignment was fine.
